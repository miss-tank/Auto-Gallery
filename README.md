The main activity in the app displays a grid. Each grid cell contains a thumbnail picture of a car (from outside the car) above the name of the car’s manufacturer.The thumbnails are separated by thin spaces (5 dp) uniformly on all four sides when the grid is displayed on a Nexus 5 device. 	Each grid cell supports two kinds of functionality, depending on whether an app viewer performs a short vs. a long click on a cell. 

A short click brings up a new activity that shows the entire picture of the selected car on the entire device display. This picture must be a higher resolution and bigger than the thumbnail displayed earlier. The user can return to the GridView by selecting the “back” soft button on the phone. However, if the user clicks on the displayed picture instead, a browser activity shows the web site of the car’s manufacturer. For instance, if the app shows a picture of a Honda Civic, the app should bring up the Honda web page from the official Honda website.
					
A long click on a grid cell brings up a “context menu” showing the following three options for the car under consideration: (1) View the entire picture (similar to a short click); (2) Show the official web page of the car manufacturer in a new activity; and (3) bring up a list containing the names and addresses of at least three car dealers for the selected manufacturer in greater Chicago area.
